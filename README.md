# IF-ELSE-Codes
all codes will be based on if-else condition
in the efficient code the problem was 
In a company, worker efficiency is determined on the basis of the time required for a worker to complete a particular job.
If the time taken by the worker is between 2 – 3 hours, then the worker is said to be highly efficient.
If the time required by the worker is between 3 – 4 hours, then the worker is ordered to improve speed.
If the time taken is between 4 – 5 hours, the worker is given training to improve his speed,
and if the time taken by the worker is more than 5 hours, then the worker has to leave the company.
If the time taken by the worker is input through the keyboard, find the efficiency of the worker in this program.
in the grade code the problem was
. A university has the following rules for a student to qualify for a degree with A as the main subject and B as the subsidiary subject:
(a) He should get 55 percent or more in A and 45 percent or more in B.
(b) If he gets than 55 percent in A he should get 55 percent or more in B. However, he should get at least 45 percent in A.
(c) If he gets less than 45 percent in B and 65 percent or more in A he is allowed to reappear in an examination in B to qualify.
(d) In all other cases he is declared to have failed.
Write a program to receive marks in A and B and Output whether the student has passed, failed or is allowed to reappear in B.
all the codes are written in c++ form
